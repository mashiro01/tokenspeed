"""Single import point for the CuTe DSL KDA AOT prefill kernel.

The kernel, its wrapper, and the AOT ``.so`` payload ship as the standalone
``tokenspeed-cutedsl-kda`` distribution (import package ``tokenspeed_cutedsl_kda``,
a CUDA-only dependency declared in ``requirements/cuda-thirdparty.txt``).
All ``tokenspeed_cutedsl_kda`` imports funnel through this module so the
dependency remains optional, mirroring the sibling
``thirdparty/flash_kda.py`` loader. Lazy imports keep the attention registry
usable when the package is absent, notably on AMD/ROCm.
``is_cutedsl_kda_installed()`` returns False there, so explicit selection fails
at startup with an actionable error rather than an import crash.

The package ships as the ``tokenspeed-cutedsl-kda`` wheel:

    pip install tokenspeed-cutedsl-kda

Requirements: sm_100a (B200) / sm_103a (B300), CUDA 13.
