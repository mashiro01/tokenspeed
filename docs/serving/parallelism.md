# Parallelism

TokenSpeed exposes familiar `--tensor-parallel-size` and `--tp` entry points
plus additional split parallelism controls for attention, dense, and MoE layers.

## Quick Start

Use this form when the same tensor-parallel group is acceptable for the model:

```bash
tokenspeed serve <model> \
  --tensor-parallel-size 8
```

`--tensor-parallel-size` maps to TokenSpeed attention tensor parallelism and
cannot be used together with `--attn-tp-size`.

## Split Parallelism

Use split knobs when different layer families need different process groups:

```bash
tokenspeed serve <model> \
  --world-size 8 \
  --attn-tp-size 4 \
  --dense-tp-size 4 \
  --moe-tp-size 4
```

| Parameter | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `--world-size` | Total worker processes across all nodes. |
| `--nprocs-per-node` | Worker processes launched on each node. |
| `--attn-tp-size` | Attention tensor parallel size. |
| `--dense-tp-size` | Dense layer tensor parallel size. Defaults to the attention replica width (attention TP × CP): the full world without DP attention, one replica with it. |
| `--moe-tp-size` | MoE layer tensor parallel size. |
| `--data-parallel-size` | Replicated data-parallel groups. |
| `--mm-encoder-tp-mode` | `weights` (default), or TP1 whole-item DP within each attention TP group (`data`). |
| `--enable-expert-parallel` | Expert parallelism across the selected world size. |
| `--expert-parallel-size` | Explicit expert parallel size. |

Kimi-K3 TP8 deployments must combine `--tensor-parallel-size 8` with
`--mm-encoder-tp-mode data`. This keeps the text model at TP8 while running the
wide-QKV MoonViT encoder at TP1 with whole-item DP8.

## MoE Deployments

Large MoE models usually choose one of these shapes:

- TP only: simplest startup path, often best for smaller MoE checkpoints.
- TP + EP: tensor parallelism within a replica, expert parallelism across ranks.
- DP + EP: multiple replicated decode groups with experts distributed inside each group.

Start with the recipe closest to your model family, then tune:

- `--tensor-parallel-size` or split TP values
- `--enable-expert-parallel`
- `--moe-backend`
- `--all2all-backend`
- `--deepep-mode`

### DeepEP all-to-all

`--all2all-backend deepep` moves expert routing off all-gather and onto DeepEP
dispatch/combine. It requires a MoE backend whose kernels own those legs:
`--moe-backend deep_gemm` (block-scale FP8) or `--moe-backend flashinfer_cutedsl`
(nvfp4, decode-shaped batches only).

DeepEP has two sets of legs, and `--deepep-mode` picks between them:

| Mode | Legs | Fits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `low_latency` | IBGDA dispatch into a preallocated per-expert buffer | Decode-shaped batches up to `--low-latency-max-num-tokens-per-gpu` |
| `normal` | High-throughput dispatch, tokens permuted into per-expert row blocks | Extend-shaped batches of any size |
| `auto` (default) | Both are allocated; each forward picks | Aggregated serving, which mixes both shapes |

For block-scale FP8 with `deep_gemm`, keep `auto` unless the instance only ever
sees one shape -- for example a decode-only worker in a PD split, which can pin
`low_latency` and skip the normal-mode buffers. The nvfp4
`flashinfer_cutedsl` kernel implements only the low-latency legs, so it requires
an explicit `--deepep-mode low_latency`; `auto` and `normal` are rejected while
the execution plan is built. Every forward on such an instance, including any
prefill, must fit `--low-latency-max-num-tokens-per-gpu`.

A batch above the low-latency capacity is rejected rather than truncated, so
raise `--low-latency-max-num-tokens-per-gpu` if decode plus speculative draft
tokens exceed it. Both current DeepEP MoE backends require BF16 activations;
`--dtype float16` is not supported.

The mode is chosen per forward from a value every rank agrees on, because the two
modes are different collectives. With DP attention that value is "every DP rank
is decoding", so one extending rank moves the whole group to the normal legs.

The prefill CUDA graph is disabled whenever an all-to-all backend is selected:
normal-mode dispatch reports its per-expert receive counts to the host, and a
host sync cannot be captured. Decode graphs are unaffected.

For block-scale FP8 decode on NVIDIA, the low-latency path keeps routing
metadata in DeepEP's required contiguous int64/float32 formats across both
collective legs. Ordinary softmax routing selects experts and normalizes their
weights in one Triton launch before dispatch, instead of materializing the
full softmax and launching separate ATen top-k, reduction, and division kernels.
Its fused SwiGLU quantizer writes packed UE8M0 scales directly
in DeepGEMM's MN-major TMA layout, so padded rows need no zero-fill and the
second expert GEMM needs no separate activation-scale transpose/pack pass.
For sparse decode it launches a bounded number of row splits per expert and
walks only rows below the device-side expert count; full-capacity workloads
retain one-CTA-per-row parallelism. The host-side expected-row estimate selects
between these mappings without synchronizing the expert counts to the CPU.
Expert weight scales are expanded and packed once when weights are loaded,
instead of ahead of both expert GEMMs in every layer forward. Shared-expert work
is queued between the dispatch send and receive legs to overlap the collective
whenever the model has a shared expert. Low-latency dispatch asks DeepEP to
produce packed UE8M0 scales directly in its column-major TMA layout. Normal-mode
dispatch still transports FP32 power-of-two scales, but the existing expert
scatter packs them while permuting tokens, so neither mode needs a separate
sequence of elementwise shifts, fills, copies, and a transpose before GEMM1.

On SM100, dense `(128, 128)` FP8 projections also keep FlashInfer's MN-major
scale layout through the decode hot path. Weight scales are transposed once
after loading, while online activation quantization writes MN-major scales and
the at-most-three padded rows directly. This removes the per-projection scale
transposes plus the zero/one fills and device-to-device padding copies that
would otherwise run between activation quantization and GEMM. The runtime sets
``prepacked_scales=True`` only for this prepared path. Generic callers keep the
default canonical-scale contract, for which the FlashInfer wrapper performs the
compatibility conversion.

## Multi-Node

Set these explicitly:

```bash
tokenspeed serve <model> \
  --nnodes 2 \
  --node-rank 0 \
  --nprocs-per-node 8 \
  --world-size 16 \
  --dist-init-addr <rank0-host>:25000
```

Each node must use the same model, backend, precision, and scheduler settings.
Only `--node-rank` should differ between nodes.

Run one `tokenspeed serve` per node. Node rank 0 serves the HTTP API; higher
ranks run the engine only and expose no endpoint.

### Under a launcher

Inside a multi-node Slurm step, `--nnodes`, `--node-rank` and
`--dist-init-addr` are all derived from the step environment when they are not
given, so the same command line runs on every node:

```bash
srun --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=1 tokenspeed serve <model> --attn-tp-size 16
```

| Argument | Derived from |
| --- | --- |
| `--nnodes` | `SLURM_STEP_NUM_NODES` |
| `--node-rank` | `SLURM_NODEID` |
| `--dist-init-addr` | first host of `SLURM_STEP_NODELIST`, port 23456 |

Rules:

- An explicit `--nnodes` or `--node-rank` that contradicts the environment is
  an error, not an override. Omit the flag to accept the launcher's value.
- An explicit `--dist-init-addr` is always used as given.
- Derivation only engages inside an `srun` step of more than one node. Outside
  a step — including the batch script of a multi-node `sbatch` — or in a
  single-node step, behavior is unchanged: launch the ranks yourself and pass
  `--nnodes`/`--node-rank`/`--dist-init-addr`.
- If a multi-node step is detected but the topology cannot be resolved,
  startup fails with the reason rather than falling back to a single node.
- The derived address is the one the head node's hostname resolves to. Where
  that is not the interface you want carrying bootstrap traffic, set
  `--dist-init-addr` explicitly.
- `GLOO_SOCKET_IFNAME` and `NCCL_SOCKET_IFNAME` are set from the interface that
  routes to the head node, unless already present in the environment. Gloo
  needs this: it has no peer-address heuristic and otherwise binds whatever the
  local hostname resolves to, which is a loopback entry on many hosts. NCCL
  normally selects correctly on its own; it is set for consistency.
- `NCCL_IB_HCA` is not set. NCCL's own device selection prefers the
  higher-bandwidth InfiniBand devices and skips Ethernet-link ones.
- The rendezvous port is a fixed constant, not a function of `--port`. Every
  node has to arrive at the same port without talking to any other node, and
  under `tokenspeed serve` the engine's own port is allocated per node. The
  constant also stays clear of the kernel's ephemeral range, which is checked
  at startup. Pass `--dist-init-addr` to use a different port.

Apply the same NCCL transport and channel settings on every node as well. In
particular, do not mix IB and Socket selection or different
`NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS` / `NCCL_MAX_NCHANNELS` values across ranks.

## Runtime Notes

Overlap scheduling can prepare the next forward on the CPU while the previous
forward's non-blocking host-to-device copies are still in flight. Any pinned CPU
staging buffer used for per-step model inputs must therefore have per-step
lifetime, or use an explicit synchronization before reuse. This applies to
MTP/GDN mamba state indices as well as token, length, and request-pool inputs.

CUDA IPC and symmetric-memory collectives are node-local. `AutoBackend` routes
cross-node all-reduce, all-gather, and token all-gather/reduce-scatter groups to
NCCL. Logits all-gather and distributed argmax use the same cross-node fallback.
This is required for layouts such as attention DP with dense TP or MoE EP
spanning nodes.

On ARM systems, [NCCL 2.29.3](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl/releases/tag/v2.29.3-1)
fixes a weak compare-and-swap failure that can hang NCCL when it was compiled
with GCC older than 10. Affected NCCL builds older than 2.29.3 can exhaust proxy
operations during repeated multi-node CUDA graph replay. Use NCCL 2.29.3 or
newer for this configuration. Disabling CUDA graphs avoids the affected path,
but is not required with the fixed NCCL runtime.

## Validation

Before benchmarking:

- verify every rank starts and joins the distributed group
- verify the API responds before sending load
- confirm GPU visibility and process placement
- compare output correctness before tuning throughput
- keep the full launch command with benchmark results
