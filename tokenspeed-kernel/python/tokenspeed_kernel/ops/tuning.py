"""Kernel autotune lifecycle.

Tunable kernels (the flashinfer MoE and GEMM families) profile their candidate
tactics only while the tuning window is open, and take each library's heuristic
tactic otherwise. The runtime opens exactly one window during engine startup,
around a dummy forward at the largest token count it will ever serve, and closes
it before any CUDA graph capture -- a captured graph records the tactic chosen
at capture time, so tuning afterwards cannot change a replay.

The window is CLOSED by default. Tuning during serving would be a hazard twice
over: it blocks the launch thread for the whole profiling run, and under tensor
parallelism ranks that tune at different times miss their next collective and
deadlock. Shapes first seen outside the window run on each library's fallback
tactics instead -- slower, never stalled.

:func:`load_flashinfer_tuning_cache` seeds the flashinfer autotuner from a
pre-swept tactic table before the window opens. Entries loaded from the
table win over live profiling, so covered shapes skip their startup tuning
pass entirely -- and every rank loading the same table picks the same tactics,
removing the rank-divergence hazard above for covered shapes.

For shapes the table does not cover, :func:`set_autotune_process_group`
averages per-tactic timings across ranks during the window, so live-tuned
shapes converge on one tactic as well.
