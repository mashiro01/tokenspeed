# msgpack wire format for the direct SMG <-> scheduler ZMQ path.
#
# The data plane carries the NATIVE tagged io_struct types (see io_struct):
# a request frame decodes straight into ``TokenizedGenerateReqInput`` and a
# per-step output is the slim ``BatchTokenIDOutSlim`` slice, so there is no
# duplicate wire-struct layer to keep in sync. This module keeps only the
# transport-level pieces of the contract:
#
#   * the single-byte request-type frame (ADD/ABORT) that lets the receiver
#     dispatch without decoding the payload;
#   * the map-encoded startup-handshake structs (HELLO/INIT/READY plus the
#     engine's ready response), which match the frontend's
#     ``rmp_serde::to_vec_named`` codec and must NOT be positional.
