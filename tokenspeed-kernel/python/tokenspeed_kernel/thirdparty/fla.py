"""Single import point for the optional third-party flash-linear-attention (``fla``).

Kimi-K3's KDA (Kimi Delta Attention) uses ``fla``'s per-channel
``chunk_kda`` and ``fused_recurrent_kda`` implementations. All ``fla`` imports
funnel through this module so the dependency stays optional and isolated
(mirroring ``_triton.py`` for tokenspeed-triton). Imports remain lazy so
importing tokenspeed-kernel never requires ``fla``.

# Stock-triton / tokenspeed-triton coexistence shim.
#
# fla compiles its kernels against the stock ``triton`` package (a torch dep),
# whose JIT only accepts host helpers wrapped as ``ConstexprFunction`` inside a
# kernel body. Importing tokenspeed-triton (pulled in by the runtime's triton
# ops) un-wraps stock ``triton.next_power_of_2`` back to a plain function, so
# fla's kernels then fail to compile ("Unsupported function referenced:
# next_power_of_2"). Re-wrap the affected constexpr builtins before each fla
# call. Isolated to the stock ``triton`` module (fla's), so it does not affect
# tokenspeed-triton kernels.
