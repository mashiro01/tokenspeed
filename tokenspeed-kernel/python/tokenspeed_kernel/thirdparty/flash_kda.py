"""Single import point for the optional third-party ``flash-kda`` package.

FlashKDA (MoonshotAI) is a two-kernel CUTLASS implementation of chunked KDA
prefill. It applies the safe gate, beta sigmoid, and QK L2 normalization
in-kernel. All ``flash_kda`` imports funnel through this module, and lazy imports
keep the optional dependency isolated from unrelated tokenspeed-kernel
operations.

The package ships as the ``tokenspeed-flashkda`` wheel (declared in
``requirements/cuda-thirdparty.txt``):

    pip install tokenspeed-flashkda

Requirements: SM90+, CUDA 12.9+, PyTorch 2.4+ (K = V = 128 only).
