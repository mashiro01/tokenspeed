"""Regression test for the MTP draft NaN under CUDA graph (DP + MoE).

Root cause: the draft first-step MoE all-gather (``draft_first_step_reduce``)
sizes its TritonRSAG collective from ``ctx.global_bs``. The CUDA graph capture
path (``CudaGraphWrapper._capture_one``) set ``ctx.global_num_tokens`` to a
uniform dummy but left ``ctx.global_bs`` as ``None``. With ``global_bs is None``
the draft MoE scattered-token-count helper falls back to a *single-rank* layout
(only the local rank has tokens), whereas at replay ``ctx.global_bs`` is the live
per-rank batch list and yields a *multi-rank* layout. Because the RSAG kernel's
offsets/launch are frozen at capture, the captured single-rank layout no longer
matches the replayed multi-rank layout and the gather reads uninitialized
symmetric memory -> NaN draft logits -> ``accept_rate`` collapses to 0.

The fix sets ``ctx.global_bs`` at capture the same way ``global_num_tokens`` is
set, so the captured layout matches the replayed layout.

These tests are pure-Python (no GPU / NCCL): they assert the layout invariant
that the fix restores.
