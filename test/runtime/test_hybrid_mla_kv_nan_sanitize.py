"""``LayerMappedKVPool.set_mla_kv_buffer`` layer remap + write pass-through.

Context (the Kimi-K3 CUDA graph "!!!" bug): under the prefill breakable graph,
the dummy-batch capture (out_cache_loc == the reserved ``dummy_kv_slot``)
writes NaN K/V. The paged MLA decode kernel then reads that shared dummy slot
through the zero-padded block-table entries and computes ``q·k`` *before* the
causal mask, so ``NaN + -inf = NaN`` survives the mask and poisons a live row's
softmax -> all-NaN logits -> ``argmax`` picks token 0 ("!"). Eager prefill leaves
the dummy slot finite (``q·0`` masks cleanly), so the bug only appears with the
prefill graph on. The wrapper requests sanitization from the cache writer so
the cache never stores NaN without allocating temporary tensors.
